The 'prices.py' script contains different python functions designed to webscrape
stocks, crypto and curriency prices from various finance websites to give you
real time information, and automate the entire process for you.

As someone who regularly keeps up to date with the markets, detailing and managing my personal finance,
I decided to make this tool so that it will be a lot easier and streamlined for me and others 
out there as well.
