The 'prices.py' script contains different python functions designed to webscrape
stocks, crypto and curriency prices from various finance websites to give you
real time information, and automate the entire process for you.

As someone who regularly keeps up to date with the markets, detailing and managing my personal finance,
I decided to design this tool to make the task a lot easier and streamlined for me
and anyone else that may need it.
